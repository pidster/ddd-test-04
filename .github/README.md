## How to Use These Instructions

### For Developers
1. **Start with the main instructions** to understand the project context
2. **Reference specific files** based on what you're working on:
   - Backend development ‚Üí `copilot-backend.md`
   - Frontend development ‚Üí `copilot-frontend.md`
   - Domain modeling ‚Üí `copilot-ddd.md`
   - Writing tests ‚Üí `copilot-testing.md`

### For AI Assistants
These instructions provide:
- **Context about the business domain** (insurance company)
- **Architectural constraints** that must be respected
- **Code patterns and examples** for consistent implementation
- **Testing requirements** for quality assurance
- **Technology-specific guidance** for different parts of the stack

## Key Principles to Remember

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Respect bounded context boundaries** - Never access other contexts directly
- **Use ubiquitous language** consistently across code and documentation
- **Protect aggregate invariants** through proper encapsulation
- **Publish domain events** for cross-context communication

### Code Quality
- **Follow established patterns** shown in the examples
- **Maintain high test coverage** with meaningful tests
- **Use proper error handling** with domain-specific exceptions
- **Document architectural decisions** when making significant changes

### Architecture
- **Hexagonal architecture** for backend services
- **Clean separation** between domain, application, infrastructure, and interface layers
- **Event-driven communication** between bounded contexts
- **API-first design** with proper DTOs and validation

## Project Context

### Business Domain
Lakeside Mutual is an insurance company with these core capabilities:
- **Customer Management** - Registration, profiles, preferences
- **Policy Management** - Creation, quotes, renewals, coverage
- **Claims Processing** - Submission, assessment, settlement
- **Billing & Payments** - Premium calculations, invoicing
- **Risk Assessment** - Underwriting and risk evaluation

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Kafka
- **Frontend**: TypeScript 5.x, React 18.x, Redux Toolkit, Material UI
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Jest, Playwright, Testcontainers

### Regulatory Requirements
As an insurance company, consider:
- **Data privacy** and protection requirements
- **Audit trails** for all business operations
- **Regulatory compliance** with insurance laws
- **Financial accuracy** in calculations and reporting

## Contributing to These Instructions

When updating these instructions:
1. **Keep examples current** with the actual codebase
2. **Maintain consistency** across all instruction files
3. **Update cross-references** when restructuring
4. **Test examples** to ensure they work as documented
5. **Consider the AI assistant perspective** when writing guidance
