# ADR-002: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Lakeside Mutual requires a technology stack that supports:
- Domain-Driven Design principles
- Microservices architecture
- Cloud-native deployment
- Modern frontend development
- High quality code standards
- Automated testing and CI/CD

We need to select specific technologies for both backend and frontend development that align with these requirements and enable our development teams to be productive.

## Decision
We will adopt the following technology stack:

### Backend
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x with Spring Cloud
- **Persistence**: 
  - PostgreSQL for structured data
  - MongoDB for specific contexts requiring document storage
- **Communication**: 
  - REST APIs for synchronous communication
  - Apache Kafka for event-driven communication
- **Testing**: 
  - JUnit 5 for unit tests
  - Mockito for mocking
  - ArchUnit for architecture tests
  - Testcontainers for integration tests
- **Documentation**: 
  - OpenAPI (Swagger) for API documentation
  - JavaDoc for code documentation
- **Quality**: 
  - Checkstyle for style enforcement
  - PMD for static code analysis
  - SpotBugs for bug detection
  - JaCoCo for code coverage
  - SonarQube for continuous code quality

### Frontend
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x
- **Framework**: React 18.x
- **State Management**: Redux with Redux Toolkit
- **Styling**: Material UI with styled-components
- **Testing**: 
  - Jest for unit tests
  - React Testing Library for component tests
  - Cypress for E2E tests
- **Quality**:
  - ESLint for static analysis
  - Prettier for code formatting
  - Custom architecture tests for enforcing frontend patterns

### DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus & Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: Jaeger

## Consequences

### Positive
- Spring Boot provides robust support for DDD patterns and microservices
- TypeScript enables type safety in frontend code
- Strong testing frameworks on both backend and frontend
- Comprehensive CI/CD and quality tooling enforces our standards
- Modern cloud-native stack ensures scalability and resilience
- Well-documented and widely-used technologies reduce learning curve

### Negative
- Teams need to maintain proficiency in multiple technologies
- Potential for increased initial setup complexity
- More extensive tooling requires maintenance
- Polyglot persistence adds operational complexity

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Node.js Backend**
   - Would provide language consistency with frontend
   - Less mature ecosystem for DDD implementation
   - Would require different patterns for handling domain logic

2. **Angular for Frontend**
   - More opinionated and enforces consistent patterns
   - Less flexible for adapting to specific domain requirements
   - Steeper learning curve for new team members

3. **All-In-One Platforms**
   - Low-code platforms or full-stack frameworks
   - Would limit flexibility and ability to express domain concepts precisely
   - Would constrain our architectural choices
