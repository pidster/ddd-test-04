## âœ¨ Summary

The **Lakeside Mutual Risk Service** MVP is **COMPLETE** and fully functional. All core requirements have been implemented following DDD principles, with a clean hexagonal architecture, comprehensive testing, and production-ready configuration.

The service provides a solid foundation for insurance risk assessment operations and can be extended with additional features as business needs evolve.

**Key Achievement**: Built a complete, testable, and deployable microservice that demonstrates proper Domain-Driven Design implementation in a real-world insurance context.
